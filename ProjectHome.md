A general, extendible statistical tool in C++ based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) with flexible inference methods.

GCAT includes the gammaMap library for implementing the methods of Wilson, Hernandez, Andolfatto and Przeworski (2011) PLoS Genetics 7: e1002395.

GCAT is intended for use on Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X. The recommended method for installing the software is to compile it from the source code. Download the GCAT Guide for instructions. GCAT depends on a number of C++ libraries that need to be pre-installed: GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and Xerces-C (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/).

Pre-compiled executable files and libraries are available for Download for Ubuntu 10.10 and Mac OSX Snow Leopard.
