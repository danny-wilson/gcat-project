General Computational Analysis Tool

A general, extendible statistical tool in C++ based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) with flexible inference methods.

GCAT includes the gammaMap library for implementing the methods of Wilson, Hernandez, Andolfatto and Przeworski (2011) PLoS Genetics 7: e1002395.

This source code allows GCAT and gammaMap to be run using Docker and Singularity. A pre-built image is available from https://hub.docker.com/r/dannywilson/gcat-project/

GCAT was originally designed for use on Unix-based operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X. The software can be compiled from the source code. Compiling GCAT requires a number of C++ libraries be pre-installed: GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) and Xerces-C (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/). Download the GCAT Guide for instructions.

Pre-compiled executable files and libraries are available for Download for Ubuntu 10.10 and Mac OSX Snow Leopard.
